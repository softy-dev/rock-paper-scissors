:arrow_forward: **[Live preview!](https://softy-dev.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)**

This is an implementation of a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where a player competes against the computer. The game consists of 5 rounds. Each round, the player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer makes a random choice, thus determining the winner of each round. The game will display the scores and announce the overall winner after 5 rounds. It also features score tracking and round tracking on every round played.
